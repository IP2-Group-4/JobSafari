<h3>Code Explanation</h3>

<p>The page's structure is built using HTML5 & CSS, ensuring proper content organization and layout.
    It consists of a navigation bar, a search form, and sections for presenting Covid-19 statistics. 
    Semantically meaningful HTML tags enhance accessibility and search engine optimization. Furthermore, the stylesheet enriches the visual presentation and responsiveness of the page.
    It defines styles for the navigation bar, search forms, and statistics sections, and incorporates responsive design techniques to adapt to different screen sizes.
    Interactivity is achieved through JavaScript and the jQuery library, as reflected in the "healthcare.js" script.
    This script facilitates dynamic data retrieval, manipulation, and display. 
    It seamlessly interacts with external APIs to fetch current Covid-19 statistics for the selected country. As a result, upon user input and button click, the JavaScript code employs the Fetch API to communicate with the "disease.sh" API.
    The latter responds with relevant data, including total cases, total deaths, total recovered, and active cases for the specified country. 
    These statistics are then dynamically injected into the HTML to offer users accurate, up-to-date information.</p><br>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The "Country Covid Status" page exemplifies the effective integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an informative, engaging user interface. 
    By seamlessly interfacing with external APIs, the page empowers users to access real-time Covid-19 statistics for specific countries.
