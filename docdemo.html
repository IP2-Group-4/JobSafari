<h3>Code Explannation</h3>

<p>The HTML structure of the "Country Demographics" page is designed with clarity and user-friendliness in mind. 
    It employs essential elements such as <head>, <body>, and semantic tags to ensure proper formatting and content organization. 
    The page layout is composed of a navigation bar, a search form, and sections for displaying country details, cost of living information, and country-specific news.
The included CSS stylesheet, "demographics.css," enhances the visual appeal and responsiveness of the page. It defines styles for navigation, search forms, content sections, and images.
        By utilizing responsive design principles, the stylesheet ensures that the page is accessible and visually appealing across various screen sizes and devices.
The interactive functionalities of the "Country Demographics" page are driven by JavaScript and jQuery. 
        The provided JavaScript file, "demographics.js," facilitates dynamic data retrieval, manipulation, and presentation. 
        It interacts with external APIs to fetch country details, news articles, and cost of living visuals.
When users input a country name and click the search button, the JavaScript code uses AJAX to send a request to the "restcountries.com" API. 
        The API responds with comprehensive data about the specified country, including its official name, population, capital, region, subregion, languages, and currencies.
        This data is dynamically injected into the HTML to provide users with a detailed overview of the country.
The "demographics.js" file seamlessly integrates with the "newsapi.org" API to retrieve current news articles related to the chosen country.
        By sending a request to the API and processing the response, the JavaScript code creates a curated list of news headlines along with hyperlinks to the full articles. 
        This feature keeps users informed about the latest developments within the selected country.
Upon acquiring country details, the JavaScript code constructs an image URL based on the country's name. 
        This URL is used to display an image that symbolizes the cost of living in the chosen country. The image, along with a descriptive header, provides users with a visual representation of the economic context.
The JavaScript code incorporates error-handling mechanisms to provide a smooth user experience. In case of errors, such as an invalid country name or failed API requests, appropriate error messages are displayed to guide users and maintain the integrity of the page.
