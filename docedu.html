  <h3>Code Explannation</h3>

  <p class="aligment">The Education page serves as a gateway to discovering educational institutions across different countries. It features a structured HTML layout designed for optimal user navigation and comprehension.
      The search form  offers an intuitive way for users to input a country and initiate a search, fostering a streamlined and user-friendly experience. The heart of the Education page lies in its JavaScript functionality, which leverages asynchronous data fetching to provide real-time information about universities.
    The searchUniversities() function is key to this process. 
    When users input a country and click the search button, the function is triggered. 
    It fetches data from the "University Data" API, using the RapidAPI service, by constructing a URL based on the user's input country.
    The function then processes the fetched data and updates the page accordingly.
    Upon user input, the searchUniversities() function extracts the country from the search input field and constructs a URL to request information about universities in that specific country.
    The function includes appropriate error handling to address scenarios such as missing input or unavailable data. 
    It interacts with the RapidAPI service by including the necessary headers and authorization keys, ensuring a secure and successful API call.
The searchUniversities() function handles the received data, presenting detailed information about universities within the target country.
    It dynamically generates HTML elements to display key attributes of each university, including its name, location, ranking, type, establishment details, founder, accreditation, endowment, president, and more.
    The function also presents student statistics and campus details in a structured format.</p><br>
