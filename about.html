            <p>Developer</p>
            <p>I am particularly driven by the desire to harness the potential of technology
               to enhance the lives of my compatriots. With each passing day, new opportunities
                arise to address critical challenges, bridge gaps in access to essential 
                services, and uplift communities through transformative solutions. In our project, 
                I was part of the front end development team, and worked on the about us page,  
                together with appendix 3 and references pages, in our group report, to ensure a 
                responsive website that  meets the expectations of our target audience.</p>
