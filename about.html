                  <p>I am particularly driven by the desire to harness the potential of technology
                    to enhance the lives of my compatriots. With each passing day, new opportunities
                    arise to address critical challenges, bridge gaps in access to essential
                    services, and uplift communities through transformative solutions. In our project,
                    I was part of the front end development team, and worked on the about us page,
                    together with appendix 3 and references pages, in our group report, to ensure a
                    responsive website that meets the expectations of our target audience.</p>
